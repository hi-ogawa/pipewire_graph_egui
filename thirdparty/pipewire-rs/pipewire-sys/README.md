[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) FFI bindings for Rust.

These bindings are providing an unsafe API that can be used to interface with
[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org).
Generally they are meant to be used as the building block for higher-level abstractions like
the [PipeWire safe bindings](https://crates.io/crates/pipewire).

The bindings are autogenerated using [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).
